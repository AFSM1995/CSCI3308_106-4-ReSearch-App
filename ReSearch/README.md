# Team MADLADS - ReSearch

# Goal
Allow for “job” postings for subjects of university research opportunities. Allow professors
to post research opportunities and allow the students to search for potential research
opportunities that will work best for them based on a variety of factors, e.g. time commitment
and potential payment. The web app will match students with research opportunities based on a
variety of factors that will be a part of their student profile, e.g. year, major, and any other
possible preferences

# Slogan

# Team Meetings
Team will meet face-to-face once weekly on Thursdays after recitation. Each meeting will be
approximately two hours in length and will run from 1PM to 3PM. If the team has agreed to meet
after recitation that day, then after recitation, the team will head to a quiet meeting space in the
engineering building. Reserving specific meeting rooms has also been discussed if available
public tables at the engineering building become unavailable. Slack will also be used throughout
the week for digital communication.
